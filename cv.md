<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
***
* **Evaluating Image Caption Generation Using Coherence Aware Methods**: Designing a coherence aware evaluation metric to bridge the gap between automated caption quality estimates and human judgements for image caption models.
* **Adapting RL Methods to learn Fair Communication Strategies**: Adapting RL methods to optimize for maximum Nash welfare rather than average reward to learn fair communication policies across diverse users.
* **Building Coherence Based Dialogue Models**: Building task-oriented conversational agents which use coherence based dialogue state representations with RL to learn effective communication strategies.
* **Video Captioning with Multi-Faceted Attention**: Re-implemented the *Video Captioning with Multi-Faceted Attention* paper to learn about video caption models and attention methods used in neural network architectures.
* **Learning Text Representations in Latent Space**: Re-implemented the *Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space* paper by Google research to study the applications and challenges of learning text representations using Variational Auto-Encoders.
* **Adversarial Maze Generation Using Genetic Algorithms**: Using genetic algorithms to generate difficult mazes for path finding algorithms like A\* to solve in Python.
* **Lost Object Tracking Using Bayesian Networks**: An application of Bayesian networks to find a lost object in a given uneven terrain in Python3.
* **MegaVM**: Modifying *Linux* kernel to design a distributed memory framework for virtual machines by hacking swap mechanism and using low-level Verbs API for communication between nodes using RDMA over Infiniband.
* **PseudoBot**: A chatbot and personal assistant web application to assist in setting reminders and sending small emails, implemented in Python using Chatterbot API for dialogue and django for backend.
* **Urdu Alphabet Classification**: A neural based model to classify handwritten urdu alphabets using CNNs in Matlab.
* **Static Map For Reducing Runtime Workload**: Implemented a static map in C\+\+\=14 which loaded the constant key value data at compile time hence reducing the the work the program had to do at runtime.
* **SmarTOR**: Participated in the research project to improve load balancing algorithms for TOR relays as part of summer internship in Networks and Systems group at LUMS.
* **Binary Re-Arrangement to Optimize Performance**: Conducted research in re-arrangement of compiled binaries to reduce page-faults as an attempt to optmize performance by reducing page faults for loading executable code.
