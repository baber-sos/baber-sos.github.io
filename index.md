Hi, I am Baber. I am pursuing my PhD at Rutgers University under the guidance of (awesome) Dr. Matthew Stone. My reasearch interests lie in models of interactive communication which try to model human reasoning using logical and learned representations of meaning. I also focus on adapting machine learning models for applicatons like image captioning, semantic grounding in dialogue, goal-oriented and referential dialogue tasks to respect human centered objectives.
