I used to visit a gaming arcade after school daily which was my first interaction with a digital form of technology. I saved my pocket money for 5 years and got my first computer in 2006 on which I loved to play NeoGeo and Mame32 games. I graduated my matriculation from a local school in 2010 and got admitted to one of the best colleges of Pakistan - GCU in *Intermediate in Computer Science (ICS)* program. This was the first time I played around with computer programs. I fell in love with this mathematical art-form and found that for me it was easier to translate thoughts into code than in words.  

After graduating college, I wanted to join the LUMS Computer Science program but it was too expensive for my family to bear. I had heard about a highly competitive scholarship program at LUMS - *National Outreach Program* during my final year of college which funded the full undergraduate program of deserving students. The funny thing is that I heard about it at an arcade from one of the friends of my best friend. Anyways I applied for the scholarship and got it. I got a chance to work with many brilliant computer scientists at LUMS who shaped my thinking about this amazing area specially my advisor - Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui. I graduated with *High Distinction* and started my Ph.D. journey at Rutgers. 




Even though I love my work in NLP, I never really knew which areas of computer science I wanted to pursue. On top of that, I had no access to internet or a library growing up so I did not get introduced to programming until 2010 when I started my college.  

At college I got hungrier so during my udergraduate program I tried to experiment with as many area of computer science I could. My first research experience was my first summer at LUMS with Networks and Systems group (NSG). It was really fun to think and play about new ideas all the time. I worked with NSG for one summer and a semester and decided that I wanted to explore more.  

My next destination was Program Analysis group led by Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui (my senior year project advisor) and Systems reseach group led by Dr. Fareed Zafar. I worked on several projects with both groups and became interested in Operating Systems research. I thought it was one of the coolest aspects of computer systems as it gave you the most control. I worked on building a distributed memory framework for virtual machines in my final year project under the supervision of Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui and came to Rutgers with the intent of pursuing a Ph.D. in OS at Rutgers. 

At Rutgers I found out that the person I wanted to work was leaving for another place so I decided to explore research in Natural Language Processing while doing OS research in parallel. I took a graduate level OS course and started exploring research options in NLP by reading research papers. I took a NLP course with my current advisor *Dr. Matthew Stone* and learned a lot about the awesome work going on in the area. I submitted a workshop paper for the work I did in OS and started my NLP research journey under the supervision of Dr. Matthew.
