### My Story
***
I consider myself to be a very lucky person. My parents got divorced at the time of my birth. My mother was a housewife and did not have an income channel, so my grandfather took us in and brought me up like his own son. Even though we belonged to a lower-middle class family my grandfather and uncles their utmost best to raise me and provide me with all the facilities they could afford. Its thanks to my mother's and all their efforts that I became the first person in my family to complete an undergraduate degree, from one of the best institutes of Pakistan - *LUMS*, that too on a scholarship.  

Since my days of playing games at arcade center during my childhood I wanted to be someone who would contribute to the progress of technological innovation. To fulfill this dream of mine, I came to USA to pursue my Ph.D. in Computer Science and be at the helm of technological innovation.  

The fact that I have reached so far given the humble backgrounds of my family fills me with gratitude and hope. I feel it my responsibility to guide the future generations of my family and others with similar backgrounds and show them that pursuing your dreams is possible if you have passion for what you are doing.
### Research
***
The current theme of my research lies in modelling human reasoning and discourse contributions using logical and learned representations of meaning in interactive dialogue. In addition to this I am exploring several directions of research which focus on adapting machine learning methods to more human-centered objectives for applications like image captioning, semantic grounding, tracking contributions in referential and goal-oriented dialogues. I am pursuing several research directions in this regard like experimenting with new states of discourse representation, building learned models of caption interpretation and evaluation, and using cognitive modelling to represent meanings of dialogue contributions.  

One of the key aspects of my research is to tune re-inforcement learning methods to learn flexible and natural dialogue strategies for a given dialogue task. An active reseach direction I am exploring in this regard is how to reduce bias in the dialogue strategies for different types of users and make the interaction more fair for everyone through RL.
