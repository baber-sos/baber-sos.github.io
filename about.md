### My Story
***
I consider myself to be a very lucky person. My parents got divorced at the time of my birth. My mother was a housewife and did not have an income channel, so my grandfather took us in and brought me up like his own son. Even though we belonged to a lower-middle class family my grandfather and uncles their utmost best to raise me and provide me with all the facilities they could afford. Its thanks to my mother's and all their efforts that I became the first person in my family to complete an undergraduate degree, from one of the best institutes of Pakistan - *LUMS*, that too on a scholarship.  

Since my days of playing games at arcade center during my childhood I wanted to be someone who would contribute to the progress of technological innovation. To fulfill this dream of mine, I came to USA to pursue my Ph.D. in Computer Science and be at the helm of technological innovation.  

The fact that I have reached so far given the humble backgrounds of my family fills me with graditude and hope. I feel it my responsibility to guide the future generations of my family and others with similar backgrounds and show them that pursuing your dreams is possible if you have passion for what you are doing.
<!-- I used to visit a gaming arcade after school daily which was my first interaction with a digital form of technology. I saved my pocket money for 5 years and got my first computer in 2006 on which I loved to play NeoGeo and Mame32 games. I graduated my matriculation from a local school in 2010 and got admitted to one of the best colleges of Pakistan - GCU in *Intermediate in Computer Science (ICS)* program. This was the first time I played around with computer programs. I fell in love with this mathematical art-form and found that for me it was easier to translate thoughts into code than in words.  

After graduating college, I wanted to join the LUMS Computer Science program but it was too expensive for my family to bear. I had heard about a highly competitive scholarship program at LUMS - *National Outreach Program* during my final year of college which funded the full undergraduate program of deserving students. The funny thing is that I heard about it at an arcade from one of the friends of my best friend. Anyways I applied for the scholarship and got it. I got a chance to work with many brilliant computer scientists at LUMS who shaped my thinking about this amazing area specially my advisor - Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui. I graduated with *High Distinction* and started my Ph.D. journey at Rutgers.  -->
### Research Journey
***
The current theme of my research lies in modelling human reasoning and discourse contributions using logical and learned representations of meaning in interactive dialogue. In addition to this I am exploring several directions of research which focus on adapting machine learning methods to more human-centered objectives for applications like image captioning, semantic grounding, tracking contributions in referential and goal-oriented dialogues. I am pursuing several research directions in this regard like experimenting with new states of discourse representation, building learned models of caption interpretation and evaluation, and using cognitive modelling to represent meanings of dialogue contributions.  

One of the key aspects of my research is to tune re-inforcement learning methods to learn flexible and natural dialogue strategies for a given dialogue task. An active reseach direction I am exploring in this regard is how to reduce bias in the dialogue strategies for different types of users and make the interaction more fair for everyone through RL.  

Even though I love my work in NLP, I never really knew which areas of computer science I wanted to pursue. On top of that, I had no access to internet or a library growing up so I did not get introduced to programming until 2010 when I started my college.  

At college I got hungrier so during my udergraduate program I tried to experiment with as many area of computer science I could. My first research experience was my first summer at LUMS with Networks and Systems group (NSG). It was really fun to think and play about new ideas all the time. I worked with NSG for one summer and a semester and decided that I wanted to explore more.  

My next destination was Program Analysis group led by Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui (my senior year project advisor) and Systems reseach group led by Dr. Fareed Zafar. I worked on several projects with both groups and became interested in Operating Systems research. I thought it was one of the coolest aspects of computer systems as it gave you the most control. I worked on building a distributed memory framework for virtual machines in my final year project under the supervision of Dr. Junaid Haroon Siddiqui and came to Rutgers with the intent of pursuing a Ph.D. in OS at Rutgers. 

At Rutgers I found out that the person I wanted to work was leaving for another place so I decided to explore research in Natural Language Processing while doing OS research in parallel. I took a graduate level OS course and started exploring research options in NLP by reading research papers. I took a NLP course with my current advisor *Dr. Matthew Stone* and learned a lot about the awesome work going on in the area. I submitted a workshop paper for the work I did in OS and started my NLP research journey under the supervision of Dr. Matthew.
